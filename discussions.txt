Changing DB from sqlite3 to Postgresql
1. Remove gem sqlite3 and add gem 'pg' in GemFile
2. In Config/Database.yml , change the adapter from sqlite3 to postgresql and add username and password to it.. 
Refer to Config/database.yml of this repo.
3.Bundle Install
4. start the postgresql service by below code
sudo service postgresql start
5. create password for default user of postgresql by first opening its terminal by running "psql" on main terminal
then 
\passwd "username" e.g \passwd ubunutu OR \passwd admin
use this username and password in your Config\database.yml file
(for exiting psql terminal --> \q)
6. On main terminal, drop database by rake db:drop
7. create new database by below code
createdb dbname e.g create guidistan
use this db name in your config/database.yml file

All done. now rake db:migrate and rake db:seed

Note that now rake db:create command wouldn't work. To create db you will have yo use "createdb guidistan" in our main application
as it is using guidistan DB. however rake will work for drop, migrate and seed.
